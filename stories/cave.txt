After defeat Hinkypunk you check map again. You concluded that you stray from the road and have to go more on south. After couple minutes you found cave. 
- Lumos! - A ray of light get out from your wand. You take deep breath and go inside. Cave was tighter and tighter inside. When it walls almost touch your head you have
seen... doors? In cave? It was strange. And door was closed.
