There was one more thing you were doing in this time - reading book you have stolen from library. You did notes and checked old maps and you conclude that book says
about treasure in forrests in North Scotland. You didn't know what it could be, but you wanted to check it anyway. Your robes was already too small for you, spells 
with wand didn't give such good results recently and you should remind yourself some charms. You decide to take saving and go to Diagon Alley.
